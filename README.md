If you have trouble with the tutorial (especially since I had to modify the code due to an AngularJS update), simply clone this repo using 

    git clone git@github.com:michaelcheng429/meanstacktutorial.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

You might see a message that says, 

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
    
Don't worry about this; the code will still work.
